# the-athena-initiative

Hello, this site was created by FTC Robotics Team 14954 to educate users about the importance of helping owls in our communities.  

The site features an article about owls as well as plans to construct an owl box. We created this resource to be shared. 

Good luck programmers! I hope this site may be useful to you.
